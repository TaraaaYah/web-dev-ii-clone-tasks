        <p>This article beautifully captures the essence of experimental sound. Erased Tapes is truly pushing boundaries. Makes me want to revisit Nils Frahm's early work. I wonder what you think about their older stuff?</p>

        <p>I've been following the label for years—so glad someone's finally writing about their impact.</p>

        <p>I discovered Erased Tapes through Ólafur Arnalds—this article brought back memories and be and my friends listening together. A bit too poetic for my taste, but still compelling.</p>
